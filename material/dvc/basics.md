### Why DVC
- git doesn't handle large files
- may be we can use hashes - store the data somewhere, create hashes for the data, track the hashes
- why not git lfs, it still doesn't provide good result when scaling. not optimized for data science
    - doesn't offer pipelines

### DVC
- works as an extension to git
- tracks data, modles, metrics etc.. supports 
- easy reproducibility...more
