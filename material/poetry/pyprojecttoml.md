### Understanding pyproject.toml file
- configuration file standard defined in PEP 518
    - PEP : specifies how python software packages should specify what build dependencies they have in order to execute their chose build systems. As part of this specification, a new configuration file is introduced for software packages to use to specify thier build dependencies.
- TOML is chosen because it has less complexity than other options like YAML, JSON, CFG or INI
    - standard library to parse toml is tomllib. poetry relies on its own tomlkit library.
```
[tool.poetry]
name = "rp-poetry"
version = "0.1.0"
description = ""
authors = ["Philipp Acsany <philipp@realpython.com>"]
readme = "README.md"

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.12"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```
- [] sections are tables, contain declarative instructions, which tools like poetry can recognize and use for managing dependencies, building the project or performing other tasks.
- third party tools can group their configuration options under unique namespaces prefixed with the word tool.
- [tool.poetry] is where you define the project's metadata
- [tool.poetry.dependencies] lets you specify external libraries managed by poetry for your project.
- equivalent json
```
"tool": {
    "poetry": {
        "name": "rp-poetry",
        "version": "0.1.0",
        â‹®
        "dependencies": {
            "python": "^3.12"
        }
    }
}
```
- many python tools are moving their configuratoin to pyproject.toml files, some exceptions are there like flake8. which might need different configuration files.
- Must specify:
    - name
    - version
    - description
    - authors
- Note: When you create a new project with the poetry new command, the tool assumes the minimum Python version supported by your project based on the virtual environment Poetry itself was installed in. For example, if you installed Poetry using pipx on top of Python 3.12, then that interpreter version will appear in the resulting pyproject.toml file. Naturally, you can change this by editing the file.
#### [build-syste]
- isn't tool specific, defines metadata that poetry and other build tools can work with. two keys
- **requires** : a list of dependencies to build your package, mandatory
- **build-backend** : python object used to perform build process.
